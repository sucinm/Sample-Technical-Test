### Sample Technical Test

#### Sort Char From String
To create a Java program that sorts a string containing vowels and consonants, we can use the following logic:

- Get the input string from the user.
- Create two string variables to store the vowels and consonants in the input string.
- Traverse the input string character by character.
- If the current character is a vowel, append it to the vowels string. Otherwise, append it to the consonants string.
- Sort the vowels and consonants strings separately.
- Concatenate the sorted vowels and consonants strings to form the final sorted string.
- Display the final sorted string on the console.
